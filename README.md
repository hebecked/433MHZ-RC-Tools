# 433MHZ-RC-Tools
A collection of RC communication tools for Arduino and Raspberry pi. 
Including analysing RC signals, duplicating RC signals, and a custom comunication protocoll and library.

This Repository is currently not continued!!!
There are some usefull code fragments, so feel free to expand on that.
The currently most usefull feature is, that it is possible to copy any signal on a raspberry pi. 
E.g. if you have a IR-sensor/Trnsmitter connected to it you can record a transmission and replay it.
The code for that cna be found in the dublicateSignal folder.
